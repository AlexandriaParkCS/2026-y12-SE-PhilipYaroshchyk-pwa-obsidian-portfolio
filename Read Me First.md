This is your structured project portfolio for the PWA Development Project (Assessment Task).

The portfolio has two sections:
1. Student Guide - contains information that will help you complete the project portfolio. You may add information to this section, however, the content of this section will not be considered when grading your portfolio.
2. My Portfolio - This is the actual project portfolio. You must add information to this section to create your project portfolio and submit it as instructed in the Assessment Task Notification.
