In industry in most cases, engineers use the [Unified Modelling Language](https://www.omg.org/uml/) (UML) to document the design of software applications using tools such as [Enterprise Architect](https://sparxsystems.com/products/ea/) (or similar). 

As this is a high school learning project, we will take a slight detour from the industry standard and structure the design as follows:

- [[01. Student Guide/3. Application Design/AD-01 Story Boards|AD-01 Story Boards]]
- [[01. Student Guide/3. Application Design/AD-02 Data Flow Diagrams|AD-02 Data Flow Diagrams]]
- [[01. Student Guide/3. Application Design/AD-03 Structure Chart|AD-03 Structure Charts]]
- [[01. Student Guide/3. Application Design/AD-04 Input Process Output Charts|AD-04 Input Process Output Charts]]
- [[AD-05 Entity Relationship Diagram]]
- [[01. Student Guide/3. Application Design/AD-06 Data Dictionary|AD-06 Data Dictionary]]
- [[01. Student Guide/3. Application Design/AD-07 Class Diagrams|AD-07 Class Diagrams]]

With this design, "less is more".

Your objective should be to demonstrate the ability to capture different aspects of the application design with different type of design techniques. The completeness of the application design should be a secondary objective.

Use one of the following tools for your design. Both can be added as an extension to Google Tools:
