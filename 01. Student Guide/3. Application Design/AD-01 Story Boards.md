In this section, include:
- Wireframe story board(s) showing the user experience with the application. Storyboards generally have minimal context, just enough to give an idea of user experience.
- Deigns of the screens that support your story board(s). These are the screen that will be implemented.

***Sign Up Experience***
The Sign-Up page is a critical entry point for new users of the application. It is designed to be simple, secure, and welcoming, encouraging young people to begin their journey toward financial literacy.

New users can access the Sign-Up page from the application's main page. Its layout is responsive, ensuring compatibility across mobile and desktop devices.

Sign-Up page features a form which includes fields for full name, email address, and password, with clear labels and placeholder text to guide input. To support usability, the form performs real-time validation feedback (e.g., “Password must be at least 8 characters”) and error messaging for common issues like malformed emails or missing entries. Security is prioritised through password masking.

Upon successful registration, the user is redirected to the dashboard, where they can begin tracking their budget.

The interface is intentionally minimalistic to reduce cognitive load and encourage completion. The visual hierarchy guides the user’s attention from top to bottom, while consistent styling reinforces brand identity.
