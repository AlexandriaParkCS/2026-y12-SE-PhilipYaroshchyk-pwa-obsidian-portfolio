This section describes and justifies the approach and processes, such as Agile, WAgile, and Waterfall, that will be used to deliver the solution and the phases of the project (discovery, design, development, testing, deployment, etc.).

### Example<hr>

***Development Approach***
The project will follow an Agile methodology, allowing for flexibility, continuous feedback, and iterative improvement. Weekly sprints will include planning, development, testing, and review.

***Project Phases***
The main phases of the project will be:
- Discovery – Define user needs, research existing solutions.
- Design – Create wireframes, database schema, and user flow diagrams.
- Development – Build core features (authentication, transaction logging, dashboards).
- Testing – Conduct unit testing, usability testing, and bug fixing.
- Deployment – Host the app online and finalise documentation
