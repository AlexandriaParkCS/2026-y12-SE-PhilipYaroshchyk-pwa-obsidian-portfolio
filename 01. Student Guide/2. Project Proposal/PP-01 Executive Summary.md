### Example<hr>

Young Australians often struggle with managing personal finances due to a lack of accessible, youth-friendly budgeting tools. This project proposes the development of BudgetWise, a secure, responsive Progressive Web Application (PWA) built using Python and Flask. 

The application will allow users to create accounts, log income and expenses, and visualise their financial habits. Data will be stored in an SQL database that complies with privacy and security recommendations and standards. 

The project will follow an Agile methodology, ensuring iterative development, regular testing, and user feedback. Deliverables will include working application and related source code, technical documentation, and a user guide. 

The estimated cost of the project is $25.
