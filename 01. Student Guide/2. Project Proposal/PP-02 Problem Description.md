### Example <hr>

Many young people lack the tools and knowledge to manage their money effectively. Traditional budgeting applications are often too complex, expensive, or not tailored to student needs. As a result, students may overspend, fail to save, or lose track of their financial goals. 

This project addresses the needs of high school and university students aged 15–22 who require a simple, mobile-accessible tool to track income, expenses, and savings goals.
