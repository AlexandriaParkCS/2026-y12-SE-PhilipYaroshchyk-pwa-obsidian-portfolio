**Date:** 29 Oct  
**Project:** Portal  
**Module:** Login stuff

**What I did:**
- Changed login code.
- Added some SQL stuff.
- Fixed password bug.
- Used Flask forms maybe?

**Why I did it:**
- Security reasons I think.
- Passwords weren’t working.

**Problems:**
- Something broke when I tried to log in.
- Got some weird error about the database.
- Had to Google a lot.

**Next:**
- Make it work better.
- Add more tests maybe.

**Extra notes:**
- Not sure if the form is validating properly.
- Might need to check the user model.
- Didn’t push to Git yet, forgot.
