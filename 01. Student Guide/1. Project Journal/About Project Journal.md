An engineering journal for a software project is a document used by developers to record their thought process, progress, and decisions. It serves as a detailed log of the project's journey, capturing ideas, challenges, and solutions to maintain a clear record, improve clarity, and aid future development. 

## Journal Content
As a rule of thumb, the journal should contain all information that will enable another developer to take your position on the team and become a productive member of the team in as little time as possible when you are no longer able to contribute to the team.

Typical entries include:
- Detailed records of the tasks completed, challenges faced, and insights gained on a specific day or week.
- A place to work through and articulate solutions before coding, which helps clarify thinking and separate concern.
- Notes on design choices, trade-offs, and the reasoning behind them.
- Any relevant observations, findings, or data collected during development.
- Higher-level summaries of the project's status, progress, and key takeaways, often recorded monthly.
- Details about the code being written, documented, and tested, especially in research projects.

The Good Journal Entry works because it:
- Shows specific functions, libraries, and methods used.
- Explains why changes were made (security, UX, maintainability).
- It describes the challenges faced which is useful for future debugging and onboarding.
- It lists actionable next steps, not just vague intentions.
- Shows learning and builds a habit of metacognition.
