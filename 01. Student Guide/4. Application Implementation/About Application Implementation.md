## Technologies
You may only use the following programming/markup languages:
- Python
- SQL
- JavaScript
- HTML + CSS

Further, you may only use the following:
- Python libraries: flask, jinja-2, scss, SQLAlchemy
- Database: SQLite3
- CSS frameworks: Bootstrap

## Mandatory Features
The application must implement the following features:
- User and session management
- Secure application best practice features, for example, input sanitisation and validation, encrypted/hashed passwords, allow users to download PII data...

## Code Repository
To experience how applications are implemented in industry, we will use a GitHub repository to store the code and supporting files for the application. 

Use the following name for your repository: "2026-Y12-SE-YourName-pwa-flask-application".

If confident, you may create your own GitHub repository or (recommended) fork the following GitHub repository: 

[PWA Flask Application](https://github.com/AlexandriaParkCS/flask-pwa-playground.git)

It is expected to commit changes to your repository on a regular basis. Each commit should include a detailed description of the changes. The GitHub repository commit log is part of this Project Portfolio.

## Code Reviews
You need to organise at least one code review session with your teacher and at least one code review session with a fellow student during the project. 

Document the findings in a coded review reports, for example:

- [[CR-20251126 - Good Code Review Report]]
- [[CR-20251126 - Bad Code Review Report]]
