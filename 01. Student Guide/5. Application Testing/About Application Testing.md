We test software applications to ensure they are reliable, functional, secure, and meet user and business requirements. This process identifies defects (bugs) early, which lowers development and maintenance costs, improves user experience and satisfaction, and protects the brand's reputation.

Test cases are a set of step-by-step instructions to verify a specific application function works as expected. They include preconditions, the actions to perform, and the expected results, and are used to find defects and ensure the software meets its requirements. Test cases can be used for both manual and automated testing, and are essential for ensuring application quality.

Generally a test case should include:

- **Test Case ID**: A unique identifier for the test case.
- **Description**: A brief overview of the test's purpose.
- **Preconditions**: The setup required before running the test (e.g., a user must be logged in).
- **Steps**: A sequence of actions the tester must perform.
- **Test Data**: Specific inputs to be used during the steps.
- **Expected Result**: The anticipated outcome if the software is working correctly.

For example:
- [[AT-TC-001 - Valid Login]]
- [[AT-TC-010 - Forgotten Password]]

All, or a subset, of the test cases may be executed a number of times. A test report documents the outcome (pass/fail/not run) of all test cases. For example:

- [[AT-TR - 20251125]]
