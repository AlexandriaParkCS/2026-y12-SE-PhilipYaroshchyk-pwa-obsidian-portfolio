Many Australians struggle to set aside money for their savings account, and inefficiently do so, due to their lacking the ability to successfully manage their bank accounts. For example 2 in 5 Australians (43%) or 9.3 million people have less than $1000 in their bank account, with the average bank balance of this statistic being just $215 which is barely enough to buy groceries. This means that for many Australians replacing their car tyres or going to the dentist would be enough to cause serious financial strain. Common budgeting applications are often not relevant to their customers needs, expensive or to complex. Budgeting planners are also often ignored by the general public as they don't see the need in it, resulting in Australians leaving their savings as an afterthought failing to save or quit on their goals.

This application addresses the needs of many Australians who to struggle to save money who require an easy to use, efficient and affordable tool to manage their finances. After all, saving just $2 dollars a day will amount to 730 saved by a year.
