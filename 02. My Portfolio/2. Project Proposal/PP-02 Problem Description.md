Many Australians struggle to set aside money in their savings account, or do so inefficiently.  For example 2 in 5 Australians (43%) or 9.3 million people have less than $1000 in their bank account, with the average bank balance of this statistic being just $215 which is barely enough to buy groceries. 

This statistics means that for many Australians replacing their car tyres or going to the dentist would be enough to cause serious financial strain. Common budgeting applications are often not helpful because:
- People do not develop a habit of using them regularly and long term
- Applications are not reaching high numbers of the right audience
- Expensive or to complex. 

Budgeting planners are also often ignored by the general public as their services could be expensive, and people don't see the need in them. All these reasons result in Australians leave their savings as an afterthought and fail to save, or quit on their goals.

The **BreakingBank** application addresses the needs of many Australians who to struggle to save money who require an easy to use, efficient and affordable tool to manage their finances. Unlike other existing tools that primarily focus on planning and reporting, **BreakingBank** can suggest to make small meaningful changes to improve spending habits and therefore appeal to audiences that need financial guidance the most. 

After all, saving just $2 dollars a day will amount to 730 saved in a year.
