***Development Approach***
The project will follow an Agile methodology (specifically Kanban), allowing for flexibility, continuous feedback, and iterative improvement. 

Main benefits of Kanban over Scrum here are increased flexibility (to provide less formal and continuous flow of work) and reduced overhead (less meetings and less formal planning approach). Additionally, Kanban better suits small teams that do not have a rigid team structure.

***Project Phases***
The main phases of the project will be:
- Discovery – Define user needs, research existing solutions and find gaps in current offerings.
- Design – Create wireframes, database schema, and user flow diagrams.
- Development – Incrementally build core features (authentication, transaction logging, dashboards).
- Testing – Conduct unit testing, usability testing, and bug fixing.
- Deployment – Host the app online and finalise documentation
