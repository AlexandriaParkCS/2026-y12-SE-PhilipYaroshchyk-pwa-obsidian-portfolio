Approximately 9.3 million Australian adults have less than a $1000 in their bank account. This is a proof that existing planning applications have not been successful in educating enough of our country's population to improve their financial security.  

This project proposes that **BreakingBank** planning application could feel this gap by helping people plan their budgets and help educating them to make small meaningful changes in their saving patterns by explaining users their earnings and expense patterns. 

**BreakingBank** will be a secure, responsive Progressive Web Application (PWA) developed using Python, Flask, Sqlite, HTML 5, JavaScript and CSS technology stack. All data stored in the application will comply with privacy and security standards.

The project will be delivered using the Agile methodology, specifically its Kanban version. This will let the project to be delivered in small iterations and with minimal overheads. 

Project deliverables will include a fully functioning application with the addition of the source code, technical documentation and user guides.

The total cost estimated for this delivery varies slightly and depends on whether the domain name is required and the choice of the hosting provider and the tier.  Overall, it is estimated to be $30.
