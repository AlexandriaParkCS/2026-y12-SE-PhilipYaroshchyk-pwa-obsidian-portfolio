**Project:** Budget app
**Module:** Application implementation

**What I did:**
- Created a new expenses table for users that will store user expenses
- I added a new form that can be used to submit new expense entries added code to insert expense entries to the database



**Why I did it:**
- I did this because the table is required to keep data of users expenses, it will be used for reports and graphs in the future of the application
- The new form was created so that the users can interact with the application and insert details of how they spent their money.


Challenges:
- It was challenging to use proper syntax for python and Sqlite code


**Next steps:**
- To display a table for the user, and think about how expenses can be added simpler for the user.

**Reflection:** 
- Created an expense table for users so that expenses can be stored. This is the first proper interactive feature excluding, log in, log out and sign up. It works via the user inputing the type of expense, followed by the amount spent on it and an optional description.
