**Date:**   20/1/2026
**Project:** Budget app
**Module:** Portfolio/Project Proposal

**What I did:**
- I finalised the Project Proposal section of the document



**Why I did it:**
- It was important to finalise the section because it was required as one of the items that had to be completed over the summer break


Challenges:
- It was challenging to user mermaid extension to generate a Gantt chart


**Next steps:**
- To work on the application design sections

**Reflection:** 
- Open source tools are very useful these days. Mermaid extension made it very convenient to be able to update the Gantt chart in place instead of attaching a screenshot
