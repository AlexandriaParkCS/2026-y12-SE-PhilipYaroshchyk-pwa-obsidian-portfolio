**Date:**   26/1/2026
**Project:** Budget app
**Module:** Portfolio/Application Design

**What I did:**
- I created the data flow diagrams for the application design sections
- I created seperate sections for:
	- Login/registration
	- Transaction/entry
	- User interaction with dashboards/dashboard generation



**Why I did it:**
-  I created data flow diagrams as they were requirement for the application design section
- To make the diagram less busy and confusing, so they can be looked at as seperate components

Challenges:
- To understand the difference between level 0 and level 1 diagrams
- Using Mermaid extension for the flow diagrams
- Understanding flow chart diagrams order correctly

**Next steps:**
- continue with the application design section updates

**Reflection:** 
- I will try to use Mermaid extension to generate diagrams in this document where possible to make it easier to update than screenshots.
