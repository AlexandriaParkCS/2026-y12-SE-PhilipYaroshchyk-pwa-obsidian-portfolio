**Date:**   13/1/26
**Project:** Budget app
**Module:** Portfolio / Problem description

**What I did:**
- I looked through all the templates of the portfolio to understand what was required from the task at hand
- Did some research on existing budget apps to gather ideas from their features
- Gathered some stats on Australian's financial situation 
- Also filled out the problem description part of the project proposal

**Why I did it:**
- To better understand project requirements from the start
- To see which features are most popular 
- To understand the potential customer base
- To start filling in the portfolio work

**Challenges:**
- there were no significant challenges at this stage

**Next steps:**
- To continue filling out the portfolio
- Also to continue the code section of the task

**Reflection:** 
The stats are crazy to see knowing 2 in 5 Australians have less than $1000 in their bank account. It is really important to be able the provide the right tools to help people save more and be more financially secure.
