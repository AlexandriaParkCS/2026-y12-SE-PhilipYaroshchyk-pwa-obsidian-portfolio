**Date:**   19/1/26
**Project:** Budget app
**Module:** Application implementation

**What I did:**
- I looked at the flask documentation to understand how to manage user sessions for authentication
- I updated the users table in the database to include a hash_password column
- I created functionality for the user to sign up, log in and log out

**Why I did it:**
- To understand how to secure application
- To enable the user authentication for my application
- To manage user sessions

**Challenges:**
- Understanding how html routing sessions and databases all work together

**Next steps:**
-  Continue filling out portfolio and other application features bit by bit

**Reflection:** 
Its becoming obvious that this project is on a much larger scale than the previous one because there is much more required to understand and apply.
