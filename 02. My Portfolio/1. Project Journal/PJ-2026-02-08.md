**Date:**   08/2/2026
**Project:** Budget app
**Module:** Portfolio/Application Design

**What I did:**
- I applied feedback I received from Mr Andonov on the 3/02/26 in relation to the portfolio in the application design relating to data flow diagrams and an Entity Relationship Diagram


**Why I did it:**
- I did this as I requested feedback and the feedback was useful for making the document more accurate

**Feedback I received**

- Data flow diagram for level 1 diagrams in the data flow diagram section, needed changing because they had no bubbles/ didn't show any processing elements:
	- Updated

* With the Entity Relationship Diagrams are transactions and goals related or not, if they are related change the diagram, if not clarify why they aren't:
	* clarified by they aren't

  
**Challenges:**
- There were no challenges at this time

**Next steps:**
-  The next steps include: better understanding the code behind the project and progressing with the application design section.

**Reflection:** 
- It is important to continue to receive feedback to improve the project, though fixing issues and adjusting it to required specifications for the duration of the task.
