**Project:** Budget app
**Module:** Portfolio/Application Design

**What I did:** 
- I created the form to add new goals
- New database table for goals
- Python code to insert user goals into the goals table



**Why I did it:**
- The Goal feature is one of the key aspects of a budgeting app, so I couldn't ignore it. 
- New database table was required to store goals. The table is linked to users and goals via foreign key constraint. This way users can have many goals. Also smaller goals can be linked to their parent goals.
- The python code takes users inputs and inserts into the database.




**Challenges:**
- Understanding how foreign key constraints can be related one table and another table

**Next steps:**
- The next step is to continue to fill out the application design section and progress with the code.

**Reflection:** 
- Goals are an essential aspect of budget planners. They act as a guide for users, encouraging them to set aside money to accomplish their financial objective.
