**Date:**   21/1/2026
**Project:** Budget app
**Module:** Application implementation

**What I did:**
- Worked on the functionality to load the records from the transactions table by the user id

**Why I did it:**
- This is required to enable the users to visualise their expenses by using the data retrieved from the database


Challenges:
- It was challenging to use proper syntax for python and Sqlite code
- I discovered that the expenses table schema had to be updated to include the expense date so that it is possible to filter by this field, so that needed to be updated 


**Next steps:**
- To display a table for the user
- To review and update the UI for the improved user experience

**Reflection:** 
- Agile methodology was good for today's work because i had to make small incremental changes that included the small database schema uplift.
