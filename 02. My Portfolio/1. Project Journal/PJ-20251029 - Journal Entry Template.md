**Date:** 12/1/26
**Project:** Budget app
**Module:** Flask based application installation and set up

**What I did:**
-  Installed python dependencies required for the project
-  Set up python virtual environment and project directory 
-  Worked out how to start the application in debug mode in order for the changes for the code changes to be available in the web app during the development of the project

**Why I did it:**
- The steps were required to set up the project
- The work done was the starting milestone of the task

**Challenges:**
- It took some effort to understand which dependencies had to be installed
- As well as how to set up the dependencies for the virtual environment only so that they don't conflict with global python install
- It took some effort to understand how to start the flask application -
- ```cd src```
- ```flask --app app --debug run```
- navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000/

**Next steps:**
- To start filling out my portfolio
- To spend some better understanding flask framework
- To continue working on the code starting with the database design

**Reflection:** 
-  It felt good to finally start the application in the debug mode and see the changes made in css to be reflected in the browser. Looking forward to better understand flask and continue moving with the task.



**Date:**   13/1/26
**Project:** Budget app
**Module:** Portfolio / Problem description

**What I did:**
- I looked through all the templates of the portfolio to understand what was required from the task at hand
- Did some research on existing budget apps to gather ideas from their features
- Gathered some stats on Australian's financial situation 
- Also filled out the problem description part of the project proposal

**Why I did it:**
- To better understand project requirements from the start
- To see which features are most popular 
- To understand the potential customer base
- To start filling in the portfolio work

**Challenges:**
- there were no significant challenges at this stage

**Next steps:**
- To continue filling out the portfolio
- Also to continue the code section of the task

**Reflection:** 
The stats are crazy to see knowing 2 in 5 Australians less than $1000 in their bank account. It is really important to be able the provide the right tools to help people save more and be more financially secure.
